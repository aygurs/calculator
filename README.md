# ![calc](https://github.com/aygurs/calculator/assets/132852380/aaca57c8-c572-4f21-9ecb-4c64fe385b68)
Fully functional web calculator, using JS for the logic, with HTML and CSS as supporting languages.

# How to use
Just like any other calculator! Input your numbers and the operator you want to use to output for a result.

It should be clear what operator you're using as it is highlighted in orange. If you chose the wrong operator (you chose plus, but actually wanted subtract), you can still switch your operator without causing any errors.

You can press the decimal as a shortcut for '0.', so don't be afraid to use that!

You can also press equals multiple times after you;ve recieved your result, to replicate your previous calculation with your new result!

# Future updates
Updates that can be added in the future include:
- Form for users to tell me about any bugs they find
- More scientific calculations to transition into a scientific calculator
- Calculation history

# Why I made this project
This project really tested by JS knowledge and skills when building it. I encountered more bugs than I can remember, but I was able to fix them all and push updates to remove the bugs. It is a really good project to push your JS skills as a junior developer.
